# The Dollar Tree Website Multiclass Classification
This project contains a jupyter notebook for analysing the data and a csv file with the dataset.
## Project Description
In this project, I conducted analysis on a dataset on the sales of items on the Dollar Tree Website. I trained the dataset using the Random Forest Classification model to predict the product category based on other features. I dropped some columns from the dataset as they were irrelevant in this case. The focus of the project was to use the **CRISP-DM framework** but the emphasis was on **data preparation**, **modeling**, and **evaluation** phases. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, statistical analysis, modeling, and evaluation.
The project was trained with the **Random Forest Classifier** and evaluated using the **Confusion Matrix**.
### Credits
